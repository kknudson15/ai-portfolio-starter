# AI Portfolio Starter (Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open: http://localhost:3000

This starter is intentionally minimal and Apple-inspired: lots of whitespace, clean typography, subtle glassmorphism, and soft motion.
